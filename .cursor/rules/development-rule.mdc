## Development Workflow

## Core Principles

### Understand the action items
   - Understand the user request and action items from [action-items.md](mdc:docs/action-items.md)


### Information Gathering
1. **Search Strategy**
   - Start with codebase search for context.
   - Use `grep` for exact matches.
   - Check documentation before making changes.
   - Verify assumptions with multiple tools.
   - **For third-party libraries, always check the official documentation and GitHub repository (README, examples, and issues) for usage examples, common pitfalls, and reported bugs.**

2. **Code Understanding**
   - Read related files completely.
   - Check for dependencies and imports.
   - Verify type definitions.
   - Understand the component hierarchy.

3. **Development**
   - Systematically build one feature that makes sense and build the anchor project
   - Make sure the anchor build completes successfully.
   - On user confirmation mark the feature complete in [action-items.md](mdc:docs/action-items.md)
   - Move on to implementing the next feature or action item only after successful completion of item before it.
